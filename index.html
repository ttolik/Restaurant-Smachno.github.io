        <p>Welcome ~ Вітаємо to Smachno Restaurant where dining is just the beginning of your journey. Step
            into a total cultural experience where great food is just a bonus. At Taste of Ukraine we take Ukrainian
            cuisine to a new level.The menu at Smachno Restaurant leaps beyond the old familiar basics such as borsch,
            cabbage rolls and pyrohy. Of course we serve all those traditional dishes you would expect to find on a
            Ukrainian menu. However, we also explore the more exotic dishes representing various regions of Ukraine. You
            will taste Ukrainian dishes you never dreamed existed. Our frequent travel to Ukraine brings authentic
            recipes from numerous fine restaurants in Ukraine from Kyiv to Lviv to Bukovyna to the Black Sea and
            more.</p>
        <p>A visit to Smachno Restaurant begins before you even cross the threshold. You will immediately be taken on a
            journey to a Ukrainian village as you approach what appears from the exterior to be a Ukrainian house with
            its thatched roof and woven willow fence. As you enter you may choose your own adventure by dining in the
            setting of the courtyard of an 18th century village house or alongside a mural that takes you into a village
            market place bazar. Feeling romantic? Take a table under the romantic starlight of the orchard. Or surround
            yourself by original art from Ukraine that will inspire any appetite..</p>
