        <p class="about-us">It was a family decision to create Smachno Restaurant to share the rich Ukrainian heritage that we grew up
            with
            and learned to nurture and love. Food is a central component of the Ukrainian experience. Ukrainian
            hospitality revolves around good food and plenty of it. Our doors of hospitality officially opened October
            15, 2004 in Edmonton. We were quite comfortably happy in our original location on Jasper Ave. for 7 years,
            but fate plays its hand when least expected and we were asked to vacate the premises to make room for
            progress. Our building was slated for demolition and we were forced to look for a new home. Edmonton’s loss
            turns out to be St. Albert’s gain. We opened our new Smachno in Robson Street November 10,
            2011. In the combined locations, we have now celebrated 13 years of business — how quickly the time has
            passed!.</p>
        <h1 class="section-header"><i class="fa fa-male" style="font-size:48px"></i> Our chefs</h1>
        <p class="about-us">Sergiy and Oksana and son Tolik, are at the heart of Smachno Restaurant and its success. Every item of decor and every item on the
            menu has been carefully planned out, discussed and approved by the family group. The entire restaurant has
            been a family project from the start and every member of the family holds a key role in the mechanics of the
            daily operation. .</p>
        <h1 class="section-header"><i class="fa fa-smile-o" style="font-size:48px"></i> Our clients</h1>
        <p class="about-us">We hope that Smachno Restaurant makes every person of Ukrainian heritage proud to bring guests to dine here. We
            hope that for anyone whose first experience with Ukrainian cuisine in Smachno Restaurant will have only  positive
            and memorable event. </p>
